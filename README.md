# **Replicants**

* ### What is it?

Welcome to Replicants, a game designed to find out if you're a robot or not. Maybe you don't even know the answer. Ask yourself, do androids dream of electric sheep?


* ### Step 1 - Clone

To play the game just clone the repository using the command line ```git clone git@github.com:gekographe/replicants-tech-game.git``` or download the zip file.

* ### Step 2 - Run the server

Open your terminal and go to the replicants-tech-game repository.

Then you'll want to run this line: ```bin/rails server``` and go to the address http://localhost:3000/game

if this fail, I invite you to find more information about Rails and how to run a server by following this address http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html

* ### User Stories

`As a human,
So that I can be sure I'm a human,
I want to have a clear answer at the end of the game`

* ### Challenges

###### Going back to Rails

After 3 months using JavaScript and a bit of C#, going back to Ruby and more importantly Rails was a brutal challenge.
